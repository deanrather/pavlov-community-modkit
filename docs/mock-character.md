# Mock Character

The Mock Character has been designed to have the same walkable angle, step-height, size, etc. as the real Pavlov Character.
This makes him great for testing your terrain, geometry, etc. in-editor.

## Setup

- Click the big "Settings" button in the top-middle for your map.
- in world settings, under "Game Mode Override" choose "Deathmatch_Mock"

That's it!
Now when you play-in-editor, you'll automatically spawn as this guy.

You can even tick the "dedicated" checkbox, set "number of players" to 2 or more, and have a test deathmatch in multiple windows.

## Features

- todo, flesh this out. there's heaps tho. char, mesh, motion controllers, gun, mag, bullets, etc...
