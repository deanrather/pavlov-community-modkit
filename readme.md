# Pavlov Community Modkit

This plugin contains tools for helping PavlovVR Mappers and Modders make awesome maps and mods.

## Setup

- Click "Clone or Download" -> "Download as ZIP"
- Extract the `CommunityModkit` folder into your project's `Plugins` folder
- Put the `Config/DefaultInput.ini` into your project's `Config` folder

## Licence

I don't know. That's Dan's job. Until a licence is added, you are not permitted to download or use this plugin. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
